# APAPI

**APAPI** is a library that allows you to connect to Anaplan API v2 (Bulk, and soon Transactional) using Python. 
Here we export some CSV and import it back to Anaplan:
```python
>>> import apapi
>>> my_connection = apapi.Connection(f"{email}:{password}")
>>> my_connection.run_export(workspace_id, model_id, export_id)
>>> data = my_connection.download_data(workspace_id, model_id, export_id)
>>> print(data.decode())

>>> my_connection.upload_data(workspace_id, model_id, file_id, data)
>>> my_connection.run_import(workspace_id, model_id, import_id)
```
Check [tests/test_connection.py](tests/test_connection.py) for more examples and hints about usage.
